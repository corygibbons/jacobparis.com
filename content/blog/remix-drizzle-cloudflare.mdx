[Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) <SideNote> Not to be confused with Drizzle the discontinued MySQL database management system </SideNote> is a typescript ORM for interacting with relational databases. It gives you type-safe reads and writes, plus automatic migration handling.

Drizzle works with many different databases, and can be configured to work with [Cloudflare's distributed SQLite database, D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/).

In this guide, we'll implement this [example of Drizzle and D1 to a Remix Vite app running on Cloudflare](https://github.com/jacobparis/remix-cloudflare-drizzle).

Start with the remix cloudflare vite template:

```bash
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/vite-cloudflare
```

In addition to Drizzle, we will also need to install [Drizzle Kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/drizzle-kit), which is a CLI migration tool, and any SQLite driver, such as [better-sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3).

```bash
npm i drizzle
npm i --save-dev drizzle-kit
```

## Write your schema

The schema is where you define your tables and columns. Drizzle uses typescript to infer types from your schema, so you get type-safe reads and writes.

Create a new file `app/drizzle/schema.server.ts` and write a basic schema to get started.<SideNote> You can read more about the schema syntax in the [Drizzle docs](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/blob/main/drizzle-orm/src/sqlite-core/README.md)</SideNote>

```ts
import {
  sqliteTable,
  text,
  integer,
} from "drizzle-orm/sqlite-core"

export const resources = sqliteTable("resources", {
  id: integer("id").primaryKey(),
  title: text("title").notNull(),
  href: text("href").notNull(),
})
```

To power typescript's type inference and autocomplete, we need to generate types based on our schema. That's what the `drizzle-kit` CLI tool was for.

Go to your `package.json`, add a `db:migrations` script to run the migrations:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "drizzle:update": "drizzle-kit generate:sqlite --out ./app/drizzle/migrations --schema ./app/drizzle/schema.server.ts"
  }
}
```

Run `npm run drizzle:update` and you should see a migrations directory in your `app/drizzle` folder. This will be committed to your repo.

## Set up a D1 database

If you haven't already, you'll need to set up a D1 databases.

Create a new database named "db""

```sh
npx wrangler d1 create db
```

Paste the command output in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB" # i.e. available in your Worker on env.DB
database_name = "db"
database_id = "ccccccvktlfkrjvvrngbckuvtrrkugtu"
# Also add this field
migrations_dir="./app/drizzle/migrations"
```

Adding the migration field tells Cloudflare to use the Drizzle migrations when setting up the database.

We need to tell typescript that this database exists, so run the following command to generate an interface in `worker.configuration.d.ts`

```sh
npx wrangler types
```

which will look something like this:

```ts
interface Env {
  DB: D1Database
}
```

The remix-cloudflare-vite template currently comes with a load-context.ts file that has an empty Env interface. You'll need to delete this to get the generated one to work.

```diff
- interface Env {}
```

## Read and write documents

Drizzle should be fully set up now. Let's try it out!

In one of your routes

- add an action that inserts a new item into the database
- add a loader that reads all the items from the database and returns them as JSON
- add a form that submits to the action

You can access the handle to the database from `context.cloudflare.env.DB` in your action and loader functions.

```tsx
// http://localhost:5173/

import {
  json,
  type MetaFunction,
} from "@remix-run/cloudflare"
import type {
  LoaderFunctionArgs,
  ActionFunctionArgs,
} from "@remix-run/node"
import { Form, useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react"
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/d1"
import { resources } from "~/drizzle/schema.server"

export async function action({
  request,
  context,
}: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const formData = await request.formData()

  const title = formData.get("title") as string
  const href = formData.get("href") as string

  const db = drizzle(context.cloudflare.env.DB)
  await db
    .insert(resources)
    .values({ title, href })
    .execute()

  return json(
    { message: "Resource added" },
    { status: 201 },
  )
}

export async function loader({
  context,
}: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  const db = drizzle(context.cloudflare.env.DB)

  const resourceList = await db
    .select({
      id: resources.id,
      title: resources.title,
      href: resources.href,
    })
    .from(resources)
    .orderBy(resources.id)

  return json({
    resourceList,
  })
}

export default function Index() {
  const { resourceList } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>
        Welcome to Remix (with Drizzle, Vite and Cloudflare
        D1)
      </h1>

      <ul>
        {resourceList.map((resource) => (
          <li key={resource.id}>
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href={resource.href}
              rel="noreferrer"
            >
              {resource.title}
            </a>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <Form method="POST">
        <div>
          <label>
            Title:{" "}
            <input type="text" name="title" required />
          </label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <label>
            URL: <input type="url" name="href" required />
          </label>
        </div>
        <button type="submit">Add Resource</button>
      </Form>
    </div>
  )
}
```
