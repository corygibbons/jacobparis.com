While Remix comes with a file based routing system built in, that's just a default convention and it's actually fully customizable.

The configuration all happens in the `vite.config.ts` file.

Using the [remix-custom-routes package](https://github.com/jacobparis-insiders/remix-custom-routes), you can pass any list of files and turn them into routes.

Its `getRouteManifest` function takes an array of route IDs and their file paths and returns a manifest of routes that Remix accepts.

The route ID is the standard remix flat file convention but without the file extension.

```ts
import path from "node:path"
import { getRouteManifest } from "remix-custom-routes"

function here(...paths: string[]) {
  const __dirname = import.meta.dirname
  return path.join(__dirname, ...paths)
}

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    remix({
      ignoredRouteFiles: ["**/*"],
      async routes() {
        return getRouteManifest([
          // /
          ["_home", here("app/homeLayout.tsx")],
          ["_home._index", here("app/home.tsx")],

          // /about (wrapped in homeLayout)
          ["_home.about", here("app/about.tsx")],

          // /login and /signup
          ["_auth", here("app/auth/layout.tsx")],
          ["_auth._login", here("app/auth/login.tsx")],
          ["_auth._signup", here("app/auth/signup.tsx")],

          // /es/blog/post-name or /blog/post-name
          ["($lang).blog", here("app/blogLayout.tsx")],
          ["($lang).blog.$slug", here("app/blogPost.tsx")],
        ])
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

If this is all you want, you can get away without the `remix-custom-routes` plugin and use [the built-in defineRoutes API](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/routes#manual-route-configuration).

But this array format has advantages as you'll see below.

## File based routing

If you like file based routing, you can use a glob pattern to collect your routes together, and then pass them to the `getRouteIds` function.

This approach gets you pretty close to the default file based routing behavior.

```ts
import { glob } from "glob"
import path from "node:path"
import {
  ensureRootRouteExists,
  getRouteIds,
  getRouteManifest,
} from "remix-custom-routes"

const __dirname = import.meta.dirname

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    remix({
      ignoredRouteFiles: ["**/*"],
      async routes() {
        const appDirectory = path.join(__dirname, "app")
        ensureRootRouteExists(appDirectory)

        const files = glob.sync(
          "routes/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,md,mdx}",
          { cwd: appDirectory },
        )

        // returns an array of [id, filepath]
        const routeIds = getRouteIds(files, {
          indexNames: ["_index"],
        })

        return getRouteManifest(routeIds)
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Excluding files

There is a lot of room for customization with the glob pattern. For example, you can exclude `.server.ts` and `.client.ts` files so that you can put them right next to your routes without causing Remix to try to mount them as routes.

That lets you put `blog.tsx` and `blog.server.ts` side by side.

```ts
const files = glob.sync("routes/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,md,mdx}", {
  ignore: [
    "**/*.server.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "**/*.client.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  cwd: appDirectory,
})
```

## dot route suffixes

Or you can make routing an opt-in process for each file, by forgoing the `/routes` folder entirely and requiring every route to have a `.route.tsx` suffix.

With that approach, you can put your routes anywhere in your codebase. You can [make feature folders](/content/remix-feature-folders) where every file related to a feature is colocated.

```ts
const files = glob.sync("**/*.route.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}", {
  cwd: appDirectory,
})
```

## Automatic layouts

You can manipulate the IDs that getRouteIds returns before passing it to getRouteManifest.

This is useful if you want to add a common layout to all of your routes but don't want to add it to every single file path.

```ts
const routeIds = getRouteIds(files, {
  indexNames: ["_index"],
}).map(([id, filepath]) => {
  if (!filePath.includes("auth")) {
    // auth routes don't get the layout
    return [`_layout.${id}`, filepath]
  }

  return [id, filepath]
}) as Array<[string, string]>

return getRouteManifest(routeIds)
```

## Add optional language segment

For internationalization, you may want your URL to include the language. `/blog` might default to english, but `/es/blog` would return spanish.

Just like the above example, you can add a `($lang)` segment to your route IDs for the blog routes.

```ts
const routeIds = getRouteIds(files, {
  indexNames: ["_index"],
}).map(([id, filepath]) => {
  if (filepath.includes("blog")) {
    return [`($lang).${id}`, filepath]
  }

  return [id, filepath]
}) as Array<[string, string]>

return getRouteManifest(routeIds)
```

There is a whole video dedicated to [custom routing for optional language segments on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtLyfx0S7Lo).
