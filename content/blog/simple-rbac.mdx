RBAC, or Role Based Access Control, is one of the most popular patterns for authorizing users to do things in an application, especially at the enterprise level.

This structure means each user gets a role, and each role gets a set of permissions.

When you want to protect access to something, you check whether the current user has the right permission based on their role.

So you won't see code like "if (['admin', 'super-admin', 'accounting', 'developers', 'test'].includes(user.role))" in your codebase. That strategy leaves you with a lot of manual work updating lists of allowed roles all over the codebase every time the permissions need to change or there's a new feature added.

Instead, the code might look something like

```ts
if (!hasPermissions(user.role, ["read:users"])) {
  throw new Error(
    "You don't have permission to view this resource",
  )
}
```

and then any user who has a role that has the `read:users` permission will be able to access the resource.

## Level 1: Hardcoded permissions

At some point in your product's lifespan, you're going to need to add or remove a permission for a role. If it's ok for that change to be made by a developer, then hardcoding the permissions is by far the easiest way to handle this.

Create a permissions.server.ts file.

```ts
type Permission =
  | "read:users"
  | "write:users"
  | "delete:users"
  | "read:invoices"
  | "write:invoices"
  | "delete:invoices"
  | "read:products"
  | "write:products"
  | "delete:products"

const permissions: Record<Role, Array<Permission>> = {
  admin: ["read:users", "write:users", "delete:users"],
  accounting: [
    "read:users",
    "read:invoices",
    "write:invoices",
    "delete:invoices",
  ],
  user: [
    "read:users",
    "read:invoices",
    "read:products",
    "write:products",
    "delete:products",
  ],
  guest: ["read:products"],
}

export function hasPermissions(
  role: Role,
  permissions: Array<Permission>,
) {
  return permissions.every((permission) =>
    permissions[role].includes(permission),
  )
}
```

## Checking permissions in your routes

You can use this function in your routes to check if the current user has the right permissions to access the resource.

As part of authentication, I usually already have a `requireUser` function that throws a redirect to the login page if the user is not logged in.<SideNote>
Remix allows you to throw redirects instead of returning them, so you don't have to check the return value.</SideNote>

```ts
export async function requireUser(request: Request) {
  const user = await getUser(request)

  if (!user) {
    throw redirect("/login")
  }

  return user
}
```

This is a convenient place to put the permission check too.

```ts
export async function requireUser(
  request: Request,
  permissions?: Array<Permission>,
) {
  const user = await getUser(request)
  if (!user) {
    throw redirect("/login")
  }

  if (
    permissions &&
    !hasPermissions(user.role, permissions)
  ) {
    // Don't redirect because we don't know where to send them
    // The UI should handle displaying this error
    // and should have prevented the user from attempting in the first place
    throw new Error(
      "You don't have permission to view this resource",
    )
  }

  return user
}
```

Now this can be used as a one-liner at the top of every loader and action we want to protect.

```ts
import type {
  ActionFunctionArgs,
  LoaderFunctionArgs,
} from "@remix-run/node"

export async function action({
  request,
}: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const user = await requireUser(request, ["write:users"])

  // Now we know they're logged in and they have permissions to write users
  const formData = await request.formData()
  const name = formData.get("name")

  await createUser({
    name: name.toString(),
    createdBy: user.id,
  })

  return {
    success: true,
  }
}

export async function loader({
  request,
}: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
  await requireUser(request, ["read:users"])

  return {
    users: await getUsers(),
  }
}
```

## Level 2: Database-backed roles

If there is a product requirement to be able to reassign permissions through the UI or database without needing a developer to make the change, then hardcoding is unsuitable.

In that case, store the roles in the database and then use the `hasPermissions` function to check if the current user has the right permissions to access the resource.

Here's a sample prisma schema but should be easy to translate to any database you're using.

```
model Role {
  id String @id @default uuid()
  name String @unique
  permissions String[]
}
```

Update the `hasPermissions` function to fetch the role from the database and then check the permissions against that instead of using the hardcoded permissions object.

```ts
export async function hasPermissions(
  roleName: Role,
  permissions: Array<Permission>,
) {
  const role = await db.role.findUnique({
    where: {
      name: roleName,
    },
    select: {
      permissions: true,
    },
  })

  if (!role) {
    throw new Error("Role not found")
  }

  return permissions.every((permission) =>
    role.permissions.includes(permission),
  )
}
```
