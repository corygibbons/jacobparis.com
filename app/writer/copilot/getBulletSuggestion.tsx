EXAMPLES:
[INST]## ðŸ“„ Remix feature folders
I strongly favor the feature approach, especially for how it enables colocation
- I write code inline exactly where I need it, without having to think about how this can be re-used.
- Once it works and covers all the use-cases it needs to, then I extract the logic into its own component or function, but it stays in the same file.
- When it needs to be used in a way that maximizes efficiency and maintainability, <CURSOR>[/INST]
ensuring code reuse across different parts of the project.

[INST]## Sly is a CLI tool to add components, icons, and utilities as code, not dependencies.
With one command, or through an interactive prompt, you can choose a component from Sly's registry and it will appear in your codebase, in exactly the format it would be if you had written it yourself.

- Automatically customize each component with transformers.
- Write postinstall scripts that run each time you add a component.
- Only source code, no minified bundle output.
- Prevent supply chain attacks by detaching from automatic updates.
- <CURSOR>[/INST]
Ensure full control over versioning and updates, thereby increasing security and stability of the codebase.
