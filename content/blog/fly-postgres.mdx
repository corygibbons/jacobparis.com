[Fly](https://fly.io) is a managed container platform with first class support for Postgres databases.

By the end of this article you'll have a deployed database and a connection string you can pass to your app.

## Getting started

Use the [Fly CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/) to create a new postgres database.

```bash
fly postgres create
```

Choose whichever settings you want. When choosing a region, your top concern should be keeping your database as close as possible to your server.

Fly will output a connection string, which you can use to connect to your database from other Fly apps. Note that it ends in `.flycast` â€“ this will not be valid outside of Fly.

Save the connection string to your app's `.env` file

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:asdfasdfasdfasdf@app-name-1234.flycast:5432"
```

## Make it accessible outside of Fly

If you want to access the database from outside of Fly, you'll need to allocate an IP address for it.

```bash
fly ips allocate-v6 --app app-name-1234
```

Then update your connection string to use the public `.fly.dev` domain instead of `.flycast`.

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:asdfasdfasdfasdf@app-name-1234.fly.dev:5432"
```

## Connect to your database

You should now be able to connect to the database using the connection string. If you have [psql](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44654216/correct-way-to-install-psql-without-full-postgres-on-macos) installed, you can run the following command:

```bash
psql "postgres://postgres:asdfasdfasdfasdf@app-name-1234.fly.dev:5432"
```

If you enter a new terminal session inside the database, then you've connected successfully and your database is ready to use.
