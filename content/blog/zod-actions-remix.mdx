When mutating data in your route action, you'll want to keep track of which components are using the action.

As your app grows you'll end up having several components [using the same action endpoint](/content/remix-multiple-actions), and each will submit data with its own payload.

For example, you may have

- a `CreateItem` form that makes a new item
- an `EditItem` form that lets the user change specific fields
- a `DeleteItem` button that deletes the item

Each of these components can have their own Zod schema that is exported from their respective files.

Each one will need an `intent` field that distinguishes it from the other schemas.

```ts
import { z } from "zod"

// components/CreateItem.tsx
export const CreateItemSchema = z.object({
  intent: z.literal("create"),
  title: z.string(),
  description: z.string().optional(),
  status: z.enum(["todo", "doing", "done"]),
})

// components/EditItem.tsx
export const EditItemSchema = z.object({
  intent: z.literal("edit"),
  changeset: z
    .object({
      title: z.string(),
      description: z.string(),
      status: z.enum(["todo", "doing", "done"]),
    })
    .partial(),
})

// components/DeleteItem.tsx
export const DeleteItemSchema = z.object({
  intent: z.literal("delete"),
})
```

In the action for the route that uses these components, you can compose them together as a discriminated union.

If you are only going to accept JSON, you can use zod to parse it on its own.

```ts
import { z } from "zod"

export async function action({
  request,
}: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const body = await request.json()
  const result = z
    .discriminatedUnion("intent", [
      CreateItemSchema,
      EditItemSchema,
      DeleteItemSchema,
    ])
    .safeParse(body)
}
```

If you are only going to accept form data, you can use [Conform's](https://conform.guide/) `parseWithZod` function. It will turn the form data into an object, while coercing multiple entries with the same name into an array.

```ts
import { parseWithZod } from "@conform-to/zod"

export async function action({ request }) {
  const formData = await request.formData()

  const submission = parseWithZod(formData, {
    schema: z.discriminatedUnion("intent", [
      CreateItemSchema,
      EditItemSchema,
      DeleteItemSchema,
    ]),
  })

  if (submission.status !== "success") {
    throw new Error("Unknown form schema")
  }

  â€¦
}
```

If you want to handle JSON **and** form data, you can use this [`parseRequest` function that works with both](/content/conform-json-formdata#parse-json-and-formdata-requests).

```ts
export async function action({ request }) {
  const submission = parseRequest(request, {
    schema: z.discriminatedUnion("intent", [
      CreateItemSchema,
      EditItemSchema,
      DeleteItemSchema,
    ]),
  })

  if (submission.status !== "success") {
    throw new Error("Unknown form schema")
  }

  if (submission.value.intent === "create") {
    return createItem(submission.value)
  }

  if (submission.value.intent === "edit") {
    return updateItem(submission.value)
  }

  if (submission.value.intent === "delete") {
    return deleteItem(submission.value)
  }

  throw new Error("Unknown intent")
}
```
